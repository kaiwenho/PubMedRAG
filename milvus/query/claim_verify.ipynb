    "This notebook demonstrates a workflow for validating medical claims using Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside scientific evidence sourced from PubMed. The steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Claim Definition: define a medical claim, provide an edge from a (knowledge) graph, or propose a hypothesis that you want to verify.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evidence Retrieval: Utilize Milvus to efficiently search and retrieve relevant sentences from PubMed articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Claim Verification: Apply LLMs to assess the accuracy of the medical claim (defined in step 1) based on the retrieved evidence (from step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Result Analysis: Present the results provided by the LLMs, and use any statistcs to interpret the results."
